# Leetcode

<p> Collection of the leetcodes I'm doing with the reasoning that led me to the choices and lots of comments </p>

<p> For each question I will try to use multiple languages, especially C, Python3 and Java </p>

<p> Here are the lists of completed problems sorted by difficulty: 
<h2> Easy <h2>
